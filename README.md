### WalletHub Angular Tests

To begin, first run npm install to make sure all dependencies are ready.

There are 6 tests, each under /test-{word number} route (ex : /test-one; /test-two; /test-three)

You will find the sources for each test under `./src/app` as `test-0{number}.ts` (ex : [src/app/test-01.ts](src/app/test-01.ts); [src/app/test-02.ts](src/app/test-02.ts)) and each files contains, at the top, the requirements for each test.
